# MHW_Site_Practise
Website created to practise JS

### All the project is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (Bootstrap isn't allowed).
### The IDE is VS Code.

### Goal :
This website uses an API based on the universe of the videogame "Monster Hunter World".

The goal is to learn how to use fetch() with an API, to create a feed.

A dynamic form is made to allow the user to create an article in the feed, and to remove it too.

The dropdown menu is also created with JavaScript, without any pluggin.


On the second page of the project, a gallery of pictures can be displayed by colomn or grid
A button is made to allow the user to add a picture, and can be removed too.

A publicity banner is done on that same page.

The last page shows games created with Processing.


### The main difficulties will be :
* The part with the API, and the dynamic form, as I never worked with these notions.
* Also, I don't know for now how to add the .pde files
